INTRODUCTION TO AI:
There are various definition of AI, but in simple manner AI is a branch of Computer Science that represent the machines can have independent complex problem solving capabilities in a more human-like fashion. 

#AI is defined as the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions. 
 
 
 AI PRESPECTIVES:
AI have been defined in terms of fidelity to human performance, while others prefer an abstract, formal definition of intelligence called "rationality". 
Acting and Thinking Humanly:




Acting Humanly:
The Turing Test was proposed by Alan Turing (1950), that determines if a machine can think like a human. The test have a human interrogator, who will have series of written questions. If the interrogator cannot differentiate the responses given by the computer is either given by human or computer, then the computer passes the turing test. Still by this date no machines (in broader term) have passed the turing test. 
There are few capabilites that a computer need to possess to pass the turing test and they are:
Natural Language Processing (NPL), enable to decrypt and communicate in human languages.
Knowledge Representation to store what it knows or hears.
Automated reasoning is used to store information to answer questions and to draw the conclusions.
Machine Learning a part of AI to adapt new circumstances, extrapolate patterns.


Thinking Humanly (The cognitive modeling approach):
If we want to claim that a certain software thinks like a person, we need a technique to
figuring out how people think. We must investigate the inner workings of the human mind.
There are three ways to achieve this: by introspection (attempting to observe one's own thoughts, Observing people in action during psychological experiments, as well as through, Using brain imaging, you can watch the brain at work.

In the early days of AI, there was frequently misunderstanding regarding the various methodologies: an author would contend that because an algorithm performed well on a task, it was a good representation of human performance, or vice versa. The two types of statements are now distinguished by modern authors, which has sped up the advancement of cognitive science and AI. Particularly in computer vision, which incorporates neurophysiological data into computational models, the two fields continue to cross-pollinate.



Acting and Thinking Rationally:
One of the pioneers in the effort to codify "proper thinking," or SYLLOGISM, or unchallengeable reasoning processes, was the Greek philosopher Aristotle. His syllogisms offered models for argument structures that, when given sound premises, always resulted in the right conclusions. For instance, "Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; thus, Socrates is mortal." These LOGIC laws of thought were intended to control how the mind worked, and the study of them gave rise to the discipline of logic.

This strategy has two key challenges. First, taking informal advice is difficult.
and express it in the formal language required by logical notation, especially when
The information is not entirely certain. Second, the distinction between resolving problems and identifying an issue "in theory" and resolving it in practice. issues even with a few hundred Any computer's computing capabilities can be exhausted by facts if it lacks guidance.
which logical steps to use first. Although any attempt will face both of these challenges
They first appeared in the logicist tradition to create computational reasoning systems.



Foundations of AI: Philosophy, Economics, Psycology, Sociology, Linguistics
  Neuroscience, Mathmatics, Computer Science, Control Theory 
Philosophy:
The first person to establish a precise set of laws governing the rational part of the mind was Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), whose bust is depicted on the front cover of this book. He created an informal system of syllogisms for sound reasoning that, in theory, allowed one to automatically generate conclusions from premises

Economics:
How one should make decision to maximize payoffs?
What action should be taken so others may not go along?
How should we execute in such a way that payoff may be far in the future?
Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher, founded the field of economics in 1776.
An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations was published in 1723–1790.
Thoughts on economics having been contributed by the ancient Greeks and others, Smith was
Using the theory that economies can be thought of as consisting of individual agents maximizing their own economic well-being, he was the first to treat it as a science. Most people consider Despite the perception that economics is all about money, economists claim that their primary focus is on how people make choices that lead to preferred outcomes


Mathematics:
Although the origins of formal logic can be traced to Greek philosophers, George Boole (1815–1864) is credited with being the first to construct formal logic mathematically.

Introduction in Chapter 1 outlined the specifics of propositional, or Boolean, reasoning (Boole, 1847). Boole's logic was expanded to incorporate objects and relations in 1879 by Gottlob Frege (1848–1925), who also created the firstorder logic that is still in use today. 4 A theory of reference developed by Alfred Tarski (1902–1983) explains how to connect logical things to actual world objects.
The next step was to establish the boundaries of what was possible using comALGORITHM putation and logic. It is generally accepted that Euclid's algorithm for calculating greatest common divisors was the first nontrivial algorithm.



Psycology:
The Brain research of AI lab analyzes the human side of information science. We think about a assortment of themes, counting shopper acknowledgment of AI arrangements and of computerized items, workers’ convictions around innovative substitution of human labor, and how investigators make sense of information.

Sociology:
How is AI utilized in sociology? 
For a few sociologists, AI isn't as it were a socially constituted undertaking, but also socially constituting within the sense that when executed in a social environment an AI framework can accept social parts, sanction social hones and frame social relations.


Linguistic:
How does language relate to thought?
Chomsky pointed out that the behaviorist theory did not address the notion of creativity in language. it did not explain how a child could understand and make up sentences that he or she had never heard before. Modern linguistics and AI, then, were "born" ” at about the same time, and grew up together, intersecting in a hybrid field called computational linguistics or natural language processing.

Neuroscience:
How do brains process information?
Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, particularly the brain. Although the exact
way in which the brain enables thought is one of the great mysteries of science, the fact that it does enable thought has been appreciated for thousands of years because of the evidence that strong blows to the head can lead to mental incapacitation. 

In about 335 B.C. Aristotle wrote, “Of all the animals, man has the largest brain in proportion to his size.” 5 Still, it was not until the middle of the 18th century that the brain was widely recognized as the seat of consciousness. Before then, candidate locations included the heart and the spleen.

Computer Science:
During the 60-year history of computer science, the algorithms have been the focus of primary research. However, recent AI research suggests that for many problems it makes more sense to worry about data and not be picky about which algorithms to apply. This is due to the increasing availability of very large data sources:
Examples:
trillion English words and billions of images from the web (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette,
2006). or billions of base pairs in genomic sequences (Collins et al., 2003).


Control Theory:
How can artifacts work beneath their possess control? 
Ktesibios of Alexandria (c. 250 B.C.) built the primary self-controlling machine: a water clock with a controller that kept up a steady stream rate. This innovation changed the definition of what an artifact might do. Already, as it were living things may adjust their behavior in response to changes within the environment. Other cases of self-regulating criticism control systems incorporate the steam motor senator, made by James Watt (1736–1819), and the thermostat, designed by Cornelis Drebbel (1572–1633), who moreover concocted the submar


Applications of AI:
AI has various applications in todays society. As the world become more advance in technology and science, it has become more essential to solve complex problems. Following are some sectors which have the application of Aritificial Intelligence:
