 INTRODUCTION TO AI:
 There are various definition of AI, but in simple manner AI is a branch of Computer Science that represent the machines can have independent complex problem solving capabilities in a more human-like fashion. 
 
 AI PRESPECTIVES:
AI have been defined in terms of fidelity to human performance, while others prefer an abstract, formal definition of intelligence called "rationality". 
Acting and Thinking Humanly:

Acting Humanly:
The Turing Test was proposed by Alan Turing (1950), that determines if a machine can think like a human. The test have a human interrogator, who will have series of written questions. If the interrogator cannot differentiate the responses given by the computer is either given by human or computer, then the computer passes the turing test. Still by this date no machines (in broader term) have passed the turing test. 
There are few capabilites that a computer need to possess to pass the turing test and they are:
Natural Language Processing (NPL), enable to decrypt and communicate in human languages.
Knowledge Representation to store what it knows or hears.
Automated reasoning is used to store information to answer questions and to draw the conclusions.
Machine Learning a part of AI to adapt new circumstances, extrapolate patterns.

Thinking Humanly (The cognitive modeling approach)



Acting and Thinking Rationally:


Foundations of AI: Philosophy, Economics, Psycology, Sociology, Linguistics
  Neuroscience, Mathmatics, Computer Science, Control Theory 
Philosophy:
The first person to establish a precise set of laws governing the rational part of the mind was Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), whose bust is depicted on the front cover of this book. He created an informal system of syllogisms for sound reasoning that, in theory, allowed one to automatically generate conclusions from premises


Mathematics:
Although the origins of formal logic can be traced to Greek philosophers, George Boole (1815–1864) is credited with being the first to construct formal logic mathematically.

Introduction in Chapter 1 outlined the specifics of propositional, or Boolean, reasoning (Boole, 1847). Boole's logic was expanded to incorporate objects and relations in 1879 by Gottlob Frege (1848–1925), who also created the firstorder logic that is still in use today. 4 A theory of reference developed by Alfred Tarski (1902–1983) explains how to connect logical things to actual world objects.
The next step was to establish the boundaries of what was possible using comALGORITHM putation and logic. It is generally accepted that Euclid's algorithm for calculating greatest common divisors was the first nontrivial algorithm.


Economics:
How one should make decision to maximize payoffs?
What action should be taken so others may not go along?
How should we execute in such a way that payoff may be far in the future?
